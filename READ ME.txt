This is the link to my website:

http://ridishashetty.uta.cloud/shetty_portfolio/home.php

The admin panel is here:
http://ridishashetty.uta.cloud/shetty_portfolio/admin.php

which will help open up dashboard:
http://ridishashetty.uta.cloud/shetty_portfolio/dashboard.php

But, to open dashboard.php, you need to specify correct login credentials at admin.php:
	User: admin
	Password: _secure@

Once you are in dashboard.php, you can update data on all the pages in the website. You can browse the website:
	http://ridishashetty.uta.cloud/shetty_portfolio/home.php
to view the corresponding changes

Other than a dynamic website, and authenticated admin panel with option to login. I've made other changes. I have
added HTML, PHP, JS validations to both login and sign up page. The contact page is coded to send the email to the
admin email ID.
